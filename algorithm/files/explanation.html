<h1>Global Justified Representation:</h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>V:set of all voters. <br />n:number of voters.<br />k:number of offices.<br />
  X:office allocation.<br />Aj:all the candidates that run to office j.<br />
  A:∪Aj all the candidates.<br />X is said to satisfy Global Justified Representation if:<br />
  For each subgroup of voters V'⊆ V that its size >= n/k and for all Aj:<br />
  Define c_V': set of all the candidates that all the voters in V' agree on.<br />
  if (c_V' ∩ Aj) !=∅ then (c_V' ∩ X) !=∅.<br /><br />
